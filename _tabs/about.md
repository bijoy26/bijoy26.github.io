With a growth mindset and inquisitive mentality, I seek empowering opportunities that offer technical problem solving, insightful mentorship and inclusive work culture.

Having led global tech communities, I thrive on technical empowerment, productive teamwork and peer collaboration. Executing initiatives and strategically growing a platform to its fullest potential is my thing.
