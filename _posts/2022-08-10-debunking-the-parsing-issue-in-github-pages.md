## üì∫ Context
 
* You keep a **GitHub** repository for documentation purpose.
* All the documents are written in [markdown](#markdown) syntax.
* You activate [GitHub Pages](#github-pages) to turn the repo into a nice little website (cause you're don't prefer reinventing the wheel).
* The site is published, and out of the blue, beautiful markdown text formattings are breaking up! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
* Googling and going through _stack overflow_ threads and [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) aren't giving anything useful. 
* At this point, life ain't making sense anymore. ‚òπ But what if I tell you, there's a way? Take the red pill üíä, and see how deep the rabbit hole goes! üëá 

## ‚è© TL;DR

> In a rush? Skip to [The Fix](#üìå-the-fix-üî®) section to get the solution.
{: .prompt-tip } 

## üç¶ Background

I'm an avid fan of cyber security engagements, and so I keep my solution writeups for [CTF (Capture The Flag)](#capture-the-flag) contests in my handy [ctf-journal](https://github.com/bijoy26/ctf-journal) repo.

This is how the `README.md` looks like in [VS Code](#vs-code) and GitHub web:
 
![GitHub View](gh-view.png){: w="500" h="500" }

After publishing through GitHub pages, the markdown-to-HTML conversion didn't seem to go the right way.

![Pages View](pages-view){: w="500px" h="500px" }

See the scaled out middle section? Clearly, GitHub's static site service is misinterpreting the markdown. Let's investigate and sort it out.

## üîé Solution

### **üìå Markdown Has Flavors?**

Back in 2004, **Markdown** came into being  with the intention of _being appealing to human readers in its markup form_. This made it widely popular in blogging, documentation, software development and readmes.

![Markdown](mark.png){: w="500px" h="500px" }
_Courtesy: `@developer_anand`_

But it had some ambiguities and inconsistencies, and so a lot of markdown flavors (syntax variations) started making their appearance. 

> üí° To solve this issue, an uniform open source specification called [CommonMark](#commonmark) was born. 
{: .prompt-info } 

GitHub made their own dialect of markdown based on this spec by extending its features. This is called **GitHub Flavored Markdown**, often shortened as **GFM**. Now we know we are dealing with GFM whenever we use GitHub web.

> In case you're curious, check out the [list](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors) of flavors and a [comparison](https://gist.github.com/vimtaai/99f8c89e7d3d02a362117284684baa0f) between the commonmark compliant ones.
{: .prompt-tip } 

### **üìå Strange Case of Dr Jekyll**

When a repo is activated for the website service, GitHub uses [Jekyll](#jekyll) to build the site under the hood and then deploy into GitHub Pages. Jekyll is natively supported by GitHub, so the folder structure follows a generic Jekyll site layout.

![Jekyll](jekyll.png){: w="650px" h="650px" }

> The configuration of a Jekyll site entirely takes place in a `_config.yml` file on the root directoy. 
{: .prompt-info } 

It offers a lot of [configuration options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/) for ease of development, integration and maintenance. 

Interestingly, there are options for markdown flavors as well. ü§î

### **üìå Connecting The Dots üßµ** 

All of the markdown variants are parsed by their corresponding  **markdown processor** for conversion into HTML format. GitHub Pages supports two such processors: 
1. Kramdown  
2. GitHub's own processor that renders GFM

**Kramdown** is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll.
In this regard, GitHub claims-
> You can use GFM with either processor, but only our GFM processor will always match the results you see on GitHub.
{: .prompt-warning }

Cool! We found the stumbling brick. üòÉ 

Since GitHub was invoking Jekyll out-of-the-box with default options, my site's GFM markdown was being rendered by Kramdown and thus the HTML turned out different!

 
### **üìå The Fix üî®** 

Following the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll), we can modify our repo's `_config.yml` file (create one if nonexistant) in the root directory. Add `markdown: GFM` option to override the kramdown parser.

![Fix](fix.png){: w="500px" h="500px" }

Trigger the build and deployment [workflow](#workflow) again and review the site once it is deployed.
 

![Pages Fixed](pages-fix.png){: w="500px" h="500px" }

All fixed! ‚úî Faith in life restored! ‚ù§

That's all for today folks.

## üß≤ Terminologies


1. #### GitHub Pages 
   A sweet static website service by **GitHub** that builds a site from the static contents of a repository. Such sites automatically bind to a `github.io` domain by default. 
1. #### Markdown
   A simple markup language for formatting texts and compiling into **HTML**.
1. #### Capture The Flag
   CTF is an **information security** competition which deals with forensics, cryptography, binary analysis, reverse engeneering and many more cyber security topics.
1. #### VS Code
   Visual Studio Code is a code editor by **Microsoft** for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
1. #### Jekyll
   A static site generator with a simplified build process involving markdown and HTML files.
1. #### Commonmark
    A rationalized specification of Markdown that defines the language syntax and offers a tests suite to validate Markdown implementations.
1. #### Workflow
   A configurable automated process that runs one or more jobs. The default `pages build and deployment` workflow by GitHub builds the sources and deploys it to GitHub pages.
